# Lab 0: Environment Setup & Verification
This course requires you to work with **Python 3** and **Unix shell scripting**. Since you may use different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), please follow the setup instructions for your system: [Python environment](Environment%20Setup%20and%20Test%20-%20Python.md), [Shell environment](Environment%20Setup%20and%20Test%20-%20Shell.md).

Once you finish both environment setup, run the following to log everything into a file:
```
script setup_log.txt
python3 hello.py
./test.sh
exit
```
- This creates a file `setup_log.txt` containing your session.
- Submit **both files**:
    - `setup_log.txt` (proof of successful run)
    - A short README (1-2 sentences: your OS and how you set it up).
