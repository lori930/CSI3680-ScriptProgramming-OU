        "     - File → Save a copy in Drive  \n",
        "     - Make your edits, then go to File → Download → `.ipynb`.\n",
        "   - **Option 2:** Download this notebook to your local computer, open it in Colab from your file, and edit it locally with your favorite IDE.  \n",
        "     - File → Download → `.ipynb`.\n",
        "4. Before submission, rename the file. Replace `YOURNAME` with your full name (e.g., `CSI3680-Lab1-LoriXu.ipynb`)\n",
        "5. Submit the **renamed and completed** `.ipynb` file to Moodle.\n",
